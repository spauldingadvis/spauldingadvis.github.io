						BRONX, NY May 1, 2020) The Board of Directors of AECI Charter Network, a network of High Schools whose mission is to create rigorous, college preparatory academic programs that provide students with a foundation of necessary skills, knowledge, and practical experiences to pursue a path leading to college and/or a career in the architecture, engineering, construction industries and computer innovation; announced today, it has named Derick T. Spaulding as the Network’s new Chief Executive Officer. Derick will assume the role in May 2020.

					<p class="bottom-20">
						AECI Charter Network Board Chair Carlo Schiattarella said, “I am delighted to welcome Derick as our new CEO. Derick is a proven leader and an experienced capacity builder who has excelled at strategic leadership and execution. With more than 17 years of experience in leadership roles in education; including founding Principal of Emolior Academy middle school, Derick has demonstrated a strong track record in initiating and leading change, driving results for students, strengthening operational systems, and innovating amid a rapidly evolving educational landscape. Derick’s educational and leadership acumen, passion to create equity driven outcomes for students and commitment to strong leadership development are important qualities considered by our board’s search committee on behalf of our communities, schools and students.”
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-20">
						Derick said, “I am honored and energized by the opportunity to assume leadership of this great Network, which has important impact on the career and college readiness of students in the South Bronx. I have deep respect for the work that has taken place to transform the experiences of students within the Network, and I look forward to working closely with the Board, school principals and all members of AECI’s school communities. The landscape of education appears to be forever changed; yet, I feel incredibly blessed to step into a role that allows me to directly impact schools and student learning in the South Bronx neighborhood where I was raised and still call home – Thank you!”

                                                In his previous role as Senior Director of Leadership Development with the Leadership Academy, Derick worked with school systems across the country to build school and district leadership capacity. Derick facilitated continuous adult learning for current and aspiring principals, principal supervisors, and superintendents to increase their capacity as systems level leaders and school building administrators. Derick started his career as a middle school math and science teacher in New York. His commitment to serving students in the under-served and under-resourced Bronx community he was raised, inspired him to pursue a career in school leadership and eventually become founding principal of Emolior Academy middle school. Derick holds a Bachelor of Arts in Communication from The State University at Albany and graduate degrees in Educational Leadership from The City College of New York and Baruch College respectively. He is currently pursuing a Doctorate in Urban Educational Leadership, Administration and Policy at Fordham University.
